They deeply believe elites create elite kids Hence they believe its more likely elite familys will produce the top talents They only want the top as scholars Its more of a selection program than tool for promoting upward mobility Look at parliament and you have your answer Im not sure why everyone feels a sense of injustice here when we vote for this model every 5 years without fail ,0.1388888888888889,Positive

Maybe its deliberate reproduction of privilege Maybe its to placate the existing elites historically speaking theyre most likely to effectively revolt But theres certainly an element of elitism in the sense that elite families produce elite children if LKYs beliefs are any indication,0.26285714285714284,Positive
Truth is it was never about your health or covid It is truly a big fuck you to all of us The elites consider us useless eaters Their minions enforcing all this bullshit are useful idiots The pandemic was planned covid is a cold flu The numbers spiked in certain cities because of remdesivir and similar drugs with no other treatment early protocols allowed People were put on ventilators which led to their demise ,-0.16232142857142856,Negative

Agreed Its never who you lost Its how you lost them ,0.0,Neutral
I didnt have many to begin with My loss wasnt from losing friends  but losing my identity as being part of an elite educational stream in an elite school 2017 was the year I finally snapped when I learned the truth through my own experience the SG education system is a huge indoctrinating joke and nobody in its truly free or independent minded or critical thinking only that theyre taught what theyre told tested what theyre told and they think theyre good because they aced said tests academically,0.28500000000000003,Positive
Well it works in the short term but paying more to make it lucrative to locals makes it more worthwhile in the long term Sure taxes will increase but as a result it builds a society where you can still make a living even if youre not highly educated,0.2671428571428571,Positive
Some might wonder why we should even cater for them Aiming for a good life should be a motivation to get higher studies right But you see a society is made up not only of academic achievers but people with all strengths and weaknesses People with different economic backgrounds People who cant afford to attend higher education There needs to be options in place at every level to at least be able to live pay rent feed family Construction work is one of those,0.18382526564344745,Positive
A few generations of making these lowpaying jobs lucrative and stable and you start having a more wholesome society Less stress on our children because there isnt as large an emphasis on meritocracy People dont have to race to be the top just to secure a living With that elitism and obsession with elite schools will also drop Less stigma on neighbourhood schools Less stigma on jobs like construction workers cleaners road sweepers Future generations can put more thought into what jobs theyd like to take instead of having to resign themselves to a safe job just to survive People with no education can make a living for their family they arent as burdened by the stress of job finding juggling multiple jobs or having to resort to desperate measures to put food on the table People can spend more time with their families You have more wholesome neighbours and fellow citizens With opportunities available to everyone you create Home,0.16964285714285712,Positive
Now Im no economist or psychic and this is all a very optimistic assumption But if the possibly increased taxes I soon will pay goes into the betterment of the very society I live in as taxes rightly should then I dont see it as a problem in the least,0.08701298701298703,Positive

The reason why people concentrate on womens and racial minorities achievement in elite fields is that such achievement is only possible with social support and societal investment eg schools opportunities Eg Until the early 2000s the PAP government capped the number of women admitted to NUS Medicine So it was actually harder for women to get into NUS Medicine than men Today its a sign of gender equality that the playing field has been evened out,0.005555555555555554,Positive

Nobody wants to learn Mandarin for cultural reasons like they do with Japanese or Korean its purely for financial reasons to make money off the financial giant that is China Its culture that gets people into a language and currently the cultural exports of most Chinese speaking countries are pretty lacking And that plays a huge part in why Singaporean Chinese are not interested in Mandarin in general If you dont have interest you wont have fluency ,0.10558035714285716,Positive

It will take a while to explain this but under this system the relative gains are uneven and this was across the whole world The political and economic elites and their whitecollared servants had more relative gains than the bluecollared workers When the wage growth of blue collared workers in the developed world stagnates and that growth is transferred to the growth in the developing world the ones who also benefitted the most from the growth in the developing world is the same class,0.11818181818181817,Positive
