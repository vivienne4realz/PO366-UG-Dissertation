Im lucky bec my parents doesnt care about my studies at all If I think I need tuition I let them know and theyll pay for it They have never asked for my grades If I do well thats great If I fail thats okay too When I said I wanted to study arts they didnt question me and let me do whatever I want I think thats where I learnt how to be responsible for myself and build selfdiscipline,0.26666666666666666,Positive
Older generation tend to impose their own beliefs into the younger generation but most of the times they forgot that times have already changed What may work back then may not work now Think less of raising a scholar but more of raising a child,0.22857142857142856,Positive
not the original poster but i come from a similar background as them ,0.1875,Positive
for me it was the thought of pushing out of the lowermiddle income bracket and being selfsufficient maybe it was also the sense of responsibility i developed as a student having to mature a bit earlier than my peers knowing that my parents cannot be funding my education forever but the most important thing was probably my willingness to learn new things in school which kept me in school even in my darkest moments,0.20606060606060606,Positive
growing up my father has always encouraged me to study hard so that i would get a scholarship to cover my university fees just like he did despite that my parents never pressured me about my grades i guess i was generally quite self sufficient and i did bring back above average grades which they were satisfied with top 1025 of my cohort in all my years in school they almost always praised me for my performance and it became a selffulfilling cycle of wanting to do better my peers and teachers also praised me for being smart which helped quite a bit i worked hard in school so that i could study what i wanted and not have my parents worry about me i also knew exactly what i wanted to do after graduating from school if that helped im currently pursuing a course my upper sec self had set their eyes on,0.08435374149659862,Positive
from upper sec i became more aware that my single mother wasnt earnig much and i could feel the financial burden on my small household i would constantly worry that my father not living with me was spending on tuition for 2 subjects in my o level year and that i was a burden to him which pushed me to work hard for the o levels despite my emotional state back then,0.0197420634920635,Positive
however my familys financial situation was hit the hardest during covid and suddenly i could feel the financial burden on my household even more i really fooled around in j2 of 2020 but when i got back my abysmal prelim results i pushed myself to study harder than before did well for the a levels and eventually got a scholarship covering my uni fees right now,0.11071428571428571,Positive
looking back it was the thought of wanting more for myself my upper sec and jc self could not afford a laptop or tablet and id feel constantly alienated when i used a phone to access google docs while everyone else had their own devices i wanted to feel better about myself by doing even better in school one of my biggest regrets was not being able to be the top 10 of my cohort that way i would have gotten the scholarship awarded by the GRC so that i could cover my school expenses,0.2636363636363636,Positive
sorry for the life story rant i did not expect the response to develop this way i just feel very angry when i hear about parents who put pressure on their children to succeed then again it might have been my unique life situationdisposition that resulted in this mentality hope this helps,-0.2583333333333333,Negative

Everything went smoothly until the interviewer asked me what I thought of the Uniquely Singapore slogan For some reason I decided to be honest and said I didnt see what was unique if Singapore was just going to do what other countries were doing This was around the time Singapore was legalizing gambling clearly not wanting to be the next Macau built the esplanade thats not like the Sydney opera house and building the Flyer thats clearly not ripping off the London Eye ,0.190625,Positive

This is the problem when scholars are recruited based just on their academic result and Scholar really is not a magic potion  Take it and youll automatically float up the high tower as accepting a scholarship one must accept the challenge that comes with it and some SAF regulars I know actually opted for sponsorship when theyre offered scholarship when they sign on to be officers,-0.0225,Negative
Not sure which organization OP is with  But I have  gathered from friends in the SAF that there are some bright kids who aspired to be an officer and they train and work hard to find their way into OCS and once theyre commissioned and posted to their respective units they will switch to man mode  For reason maybe because they can relate or think thats the way to connect with their men or maybe thought thats the best way to inspire and gain respect but they ORD feeling disappointed,0.06805555555555558,Positive

However Singapore government will not cut off water supply completely so cheapskates take advantage of it There are many ppl who can afford cigarettes yet refuse to pay water bills ,0.3,Positive

I dont think youre understanding To get into a top uni for lets say business grad school it costs more than you can pay yourself without help from your parents or govt scholarship No one at our age can pay that money without getting financial aid from the country of said university This isnt even possible because if youre not a citizen of that country you wont get the aid So if you want to study in Stanford the only thing you can rely on is your parents or govt scholarship In this case his parents wont pay so govt scholarship is the only option,0.16666666666666666,Positive
Thats not how it works  some higher level jobs you cant get because youre not qualified without a masters If the world worked on simply having talent then wed all have it easy Its about opportunity In Singapore you cant get into certain levels without a masters from a good uni Even Americans themselves who may be talented cant afford which is why their talent merits them financial aid Therefore its the same in his case but his financial aid comes from Singapore govt if you try to pay yourself it will take years and years of saving Its cheaper and more doable if youre planning on going to AUS but usually top unis are in UK and US And the US is simply not possible for anyone our age even with a midlevel job to pay for without saving for at least 5 years And if hes not as talented as he thinks he is and cant pay himself by getting higher wages but he does well in GREs and gets into the uni and gets a govt scholarship grant why wouldnt he take it,0.26317460317460317,Positive

to be clear and let me reiterate this for the malays who are illiterate there is completely nothing wrong with living a laid back lifestyle BUT if the Chinese are earning more money than you dont complain Their chinese parents gave them more attention that your malay parents bothered to give you and your 20 siblings Their chinese parents put more money into their tuition and all They had to suffer through the pain and stress of having high expectations and strict parents instead of an enjoyable laid back youth just to top their classes,0.16857142857142857,Positive

Now why is this relevant Research is something that you need to splash your money on hire 1000 researchers and hope that one of them will do a good job If the government or the public care too much about the costperformance ratio it is not going to do well in scientific research The publics opinion towards science determines how officials view science research and even when officials are willing to spend money on that whether they will face an outcry from the public accusing them of wasting the money I didnt say that this culture produces no scientists This culture affects the publics attitude towards the luxury of doing good science research,0.32142857142857145,Positive

In most tertiary academic programs first of all you are explicitly informed of the curiculum and syllabus beforehand through module descriptions and such So you roughly know what is the knowledge and skills intended to be imparted to you While it is true that the knowledge and skills is structured in such an efficient way for you to absorb just so you can regurgitate them in a assessable form during assessments exams But does that mean that you automatically lose the critical thinking skills gained during past years In fact one would argue that critical thinking is actively honed because you have to sieve out what you understand and what you dont understand for exams,0.025347222222222226,Positive
The real problem with our education system isnt that it churns out highly knowledgeable graduates who are simply not workplaceready enough because curiculum is always going to be one step behind The problem simply put is that students obviously optimize their assessment responses for grades because thats the only thing theyve been signalled to value being hired for as prestigious a role you can hook ,-0.0050000000000000044,Negative
Because if you start off at a strong starting point eg if you first job out is at FAANG or the Big 4 subsequent looks on your resume is going to look favourably and therefore future employment only gets easier and easier If your first job out is at an SME especially a nobrand SME and despite being now trained on the job HR recruiters are only going to prejudice your application also because HR recruiters often are absolutely divorced from the actual hiring process AND they get to have the final say particular with regards to compensation,0.09285714285714286,Positive

A more enlightened approach in my opinion is the tech industry where you are hired based on your aptitude displayed during technical interviews and portfolio Yes then it will shift the focus from grades towards stuffing your portfolio with as many shiny projects but it is a step in the right direction given that during job interviews assessments you have to cherrypick which are the 45 projects you want to showcase in order to show that you might be a good fit Especially when performance during inperson interviews to gauge culture fit is being weighed more and more ,0.37857142857142856,Positive
When will employers especially the government learn to be GPAblind or even pedigreeblind And when will the government slaughter one of its key policies of never being able to fire employees thus leading to the label of iron bowl employment Because the private sector very much look towards the public sector when it comes to manpower and employment policies The top private sector jobs where performance is truly much more important will always depend on actual competence as opposed to academic achievements but for everyone else they will still continue to play this wretched game of grades for as long as their employment only requires them to be 60 to 70 competent Will a FCH or a secondupper necessarily always be a better candidate than a secondlower for instance Or even just a diploma holder but their resume does attest to them being in the trenches and thus probably having a much more firm understanding of your actual operations ,0.1433333333333333,Positive

1 Almost a decade ago I was working on one of the research institutes related to a star ykyk agency the executive director was ex chief of medics The planners and policy makers had directors equivalent of senior managers in the private sector from our armed forces parachuting from various ranks like MAJ LTC etc Was part of the finance team so what they did had no impact for me but for those graduates working in those departments I have the most empathy for them Not only did they have to fight promotions with them they were up against scholars who have different career paths These will drive away hardworking staff who got demoralised by how under value they felt,0.08333333333333333,Positive
2 Why so many senior officers get moved into GLC,0.5,Positive
My hot take is to entice people to sign on and if they perform well or get into the circle they will be assured that their life is well taken care of after serving Also if we dont move them on they well be holding on to key positions in the armed forces much longer which in turn will cause slower progression for the existing regulars With slower career progression people may think twice about signing on,0.15,Positive

Spending good money to provide these foreigners with scholarships has 2 benefits adding more workers to our labour force and since were adding highly educated ones the average quality will also go up as well Why do you think the 5 years of working in Singapore is required With another 5 years spent here these foreigners will most likely be rooted here and get married here instead Of cos some will leave Singapore after 5 years but the Govt kinda expect that already If the number of foreigners leaving sg after 5 years of working here is too high 5 years will be updated to 7 years or even 10 years in future ,0.202,Positive

I kinda wanna add my input on this as a 2nd gen sg pr As much as u assume u r at a disadvantage due to ns it is a way for u guys to support ur country as much as it had supported you First of all on the topic of scholars let me give u a gauge for JC it costs singaporeans tops 50 bucks whereas scholars pay upwards from 1k per month Regardless of how much the scholarship is they rly need to work their butt off to maintain the slight subsidy which I am sure not even close to 50 bucks Singaporeans get numerous awards like ur edusave and subidaries ontop of this heavily subsidised school fees Personally I have gotten this PR scholarship every year but could never qualify for it simply because my family made more than 15kperson And let me tell u even in uni even if they get first class honours when u go into the job market their increments are not even close to that of singaporeans And let me not mention other disadvantages foreigners are subjected to which you choose to overlook like housing visas discrimination etc AND these people who dont even fit into this society get scolded for singing the national anthem or pledge still have to serve ns if their parents are citizens or prs And also they r never the first priority unless they r hella smart Singapore unis has and will always accept as many singaporeans in before moving onto prs then foreigners Who do u think pays for the lit facilities,0.14987468671679202,Positive

Maybe youre right but then again these scholars are not the type of scholars youre thinking of Yes theyre smarter on average but there are many other Singaporeans as capable or even better than them And yet they are put at a disadvantaged at the expense of foreigners And even if lets say these people manage to secure good jobs in their home countries in the future it doesnt change the fact that these scholars are enjoying the same benefits as any Singaporean but without the responsibilities They receive money opportunities and even PR but some dont even take the effort to communicate in English with their peers I would be more than supportive if these scholars are from low income backgrounds but with high potential seeking to make a better future for their families back home But these are not poor scholars They are the upper class back home and yet money is being spent on them overgenerously eg providing free iPads laptops when it is something unnecessary and something that they can honestly afford by themselves,0.19150793650793652,Positive
