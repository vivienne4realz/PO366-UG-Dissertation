This is so true After my Os i worked FB to get some extra money So many elite parents mentioned to their children how they have to work hard if not they will have to be like me When one finally said it straight to my face i raised my eyebrow and said Im a scholar at top boys school and Im waiting for my O level results The look on her face was priceless ,0.28229166666666666,Positive

 The data clearly shows that early inequalities in life often compound over time rather than average out affecting everything from differences in health and incarceration rates to success in school and all other aspects of life To use another sports example in his book Outliers 2008 the Canadian journalist Malcolm Gladwell documents the rather strange fact that there are more players in the National Hockey League born in January February and March than any other months His explanation is that in Canada where children start playing hockey at a very young age the eligibility cutoff for ageclass hockey programmes is January 1 At the ages of six and seven being 10 or 11 months older gives one a distinct advantage over ones competitors Since the older players tend to do better they end up getting more playing time and as they progress through the ranks they are selected for better teams and more elite programmes receive better coaching and play more games against better competition What begins as a small advantage a mere matter of luck snowballs and leads to an everwidening gap of achievement and success ,0.19833333333333333,Positive

The recurring existential issues in Singapore politics are definitely going to look milder compared to most countries But there are some,0.25,Positive
Elitism for instance  theres the recurring concern that the governing elite well are a governing elite In the sense that too many people in power are out of touch with regular folks and so on,0.25,Positive
Weve actually already seen that boil over to some extent with one ruling party candidate being forced to retract his candidacy over allegations that hes an arrogant piece of work People whove worked with him or more specifically under him came forth to talk about it Including the former regimental sergeant major in his reservist battalion akin to his national guard unit in the American context The former senior NCO in his unit basically told everyone that this guy is the worst kind of officer the kind of officer who belittles his men and treats his subordinates badly and so on,-0.021590909090909084,Negative
Naturally the fellow still denies the claims but the broader point is that elitism income inequality and a kind of perceived class divide is something that the ruling party the PAP is accused of And something the PAP is deeply concerned about themselves Obviously theyre aware it looks bad,0.041666666666666685,Positive
There are other issues wrapped up in this because if you assume the fundamental issue is that policymakers are wealthy elites that are out of touch then it stands to reason that theyll be accused of making policies that favour big business over ordinary people for example Or theyll be accused of media censorship and using the courts to quash any dissent  Singapore recently implemented a particular bit of fake news legislation that critics say is mostly a tool for the government to go after whatever they dont like And so on So forth,0.03645833333333333,Positive
Part of the discontent is kind of hard to unpack if you dont have the history Historically Singapore hasnt been kind to dissenting voices Opposition figures have been sued into financial oblivion Journalists and academics whove attracted too much flak have lost jobs and so on Granted these days the pressure is going to be kinder and gentler rather than some sternfaced security officers showing up at three in the morning in order to introduce you to a windowless room but a lot of Singaporeans will be thinking about that sort of thing,0.1847222222222222,Positive
Its worth noting that much of the reason Singapore was so successful was because of great leaders Not just Singapores first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew but also people like Goh Keng Swee The trouble is while they were undoubtedly brilliant leaders this doesnt mean they were nice Singapore has been fortunate in that its leaders even in what people would consider the bad old days have fallen very much on the nice side of authoritarianism  firm but ethical and seemingly respecting rule of law But not nice Not nice in the sense that what they built is seen by many people today as a rigid hierarchical system Theres a very strong undercurrent in Singapore of sit down shut up if you know whats good for you,0.225239898989899,Positive
Granted the contemporary successors of the founding PAP members are very aware of these issues They know that things are different now They know societys different They know different levers are necessary There have been obvious attempts to soften the PAPs stance to actively counter any assertions of nepotism or elitism to prove that the party cares about people And lets be clear there are politicians in the PAP who are genuinely truly wellliked by the majority of people,0.08583333333333334,Positive
Ive been mostly cynical in this comment to explain why some people in Singapore still have bones to pick even though by and large the country is doing well and is seen as successful But obviously the current batch of political incumbents are doing a good enough job They must be Theyre in power And nobody nobody realistically expects the PAP to lose a general election anytime soon,0.12380952380952381,Positive
Still thats not good enough for some Thats why the opposition has supporters,-0.175,Negative
There are plenty of people in Singapore who may not be entirely happy with the system but are willing to go along with say the nature of the civil service Or the fact that government scholarship is a big thing here with people who do well academically getting handpicked out of school and then shunted into important highlypaid public sector roles well you get the idea,0.29000000000000004,Positive
Thats fine with people if it means the government truly is run by the very very clever and everything ticks along This is the flip side of elitism Because while it sounds nice to be more egalitarian or whatever at the end of the day dont you want to ensure that the highestqualified people are indeed running the show,0.43333333333333335,Positive
So its okay in practice If the system works,0.5,Positive
The problem arises when the handpicked and favoured elite arent the best at what they do and mess up badly By and large Singapore has been extremely fortunate because its leaders have indeed been wise and have indeed made far more good calls than they have made mistakes There have been some mistakes mind you  hang around on this sub enough and youll see people point to say mismanagement of X or poor policy Y But none of those things have been absolutely disastrous Whereas a quick look around the world gives many more examples where ruling elites have dropped the ball,0.1981746031746032,Positive
But whats the alternative There are also examples where populism has caused serious problems for countries Theres way too many democracies way too many countries where ignorance and mob rule has replaced good sense and knowledge at the ballot box,0.3416666666666667,Positive
Singapore has done better than most countries but there isnt a perfect answer,0.6666666666666666,Positive

I dont understand why people are throwing around allegations of elitism Leong Mun Wais performance in parliament was absolutely atrocious Imagine having to sit through the whole trainwreck my reaction to watching the proceedings is to want to close the video as soon as possible Vivian probably made the comment as a joke more than anything else If anything Vivians jab could be considered an antielitist jab we expect RI to be the elite school yet their grads turn out to be so bad But yes it should have been something said in private rather than in parliament so as to prevent misunderstandings,-0.11666666666666663,Negative
It would be an eltist remark if LMW went to aneighborhood school and Vivian mocked that Or if someone mocked LTK for his English But given that RI grads are given more resources than other students and are educated in English it is a fair jab towards LMW If RI students turn out to be like Leong Mun Wai then really RI needs to be looked into,0.2125,Positive
Im from a neighbourhood school and I dont find this offensive If a player sucks at bball youd ask how did he get into the NBA If a doctor screws up youd ask how did she get into med school Fact is RI is an elite school Yes there are elite schools and shitty schools  grow up People are wayyyy too sensitive these days,-0.09999999999999999,Negative

So you may be able to quote a few passages here and there on descriptions of gays but is that by any mean evidence that gays are widespread and well tolerated in those eras It is obviously cherrypicking from among a few novels that are the exceptions,-0.0425,Negative
 was also so famous because it is the equivalent of really good 1010 rated deviant hardcore porn in the olden days so much so that Qianlong had to ban it It was probably viewed as heretical enough for it to be banned together with the chinese novel on revolutionaries ,0.27999999999999997,Positive
So NO Just a few famous books that have a few paragraphs depicting gays are not evidence of it being tolerable It is a hyperbole and a stretch to use these few passages from a few books that are read for leisure to depict mainstream chinese attitude towards gay It is akin to finding a famous gay club in the American deep south and concluding that those American conservative states were tolerant to gays,0.08611111111111112,Positive
Lastly I feel the need to clarify that I am critcising the very unrepresentative idea of early China being gaytolerant and not criticising the existing and current LGBTQ movement Finding allies in ancient china is not a good idea if you get transported back in time,-0.008333333333333323,Negative

Honestly the administration in each schools are also going through tough times because of the management above Most decisions do not come from Managerial level but at the Academic positions level and administration head of each school or the centralised office Some of the Profs are known to not want to teach and we always had problem with giving them teaching load They are more concern in doing research anyway The management was terribly bad at handling and reacting fast in MarApril last year that staff had to come to work everyday despite the govt informing of WFH arrangements The solution to them was to segregate the office and separate each team but we were still seeing each other for meetings in the same building It really depends how good each of the schools leadership were and that their policies differs Some staff were made to work alternate days but others were made to come everyday The lack of quality and empathetic leaders and the outdated mindset of staff who have been too long in the company and refuse to make catalytic changes along with elite circle of Profs in their own clique are some of the reasons why the administration has failed in some ways and it translates to an unpleasant experience for all,0.004100529100529107,Positive

And that is the fact that he served as a medic during his time as an NSF ,0.0,Neutral
That I feel makes him stand apart from the other qualified candidates from the PAP with similar CVs ,-0.0625,Negative
The PAP has a preference for candidates to come from outstanding backgrounds especially from their time in National Service Most of the previously elected PAP MPs or potential MPs in this election are all officers during their time as NSFs or regulars,0.16666666666666669,Positive
But does one being an officer necessarily make them a better candidate or even a leader Many of us who went through NS know otherwise and that it is even possible for someone who is not an officer to lead others or bring up concerns to higherups The Ivan Lim fiasco true or untrue further highlights this issue This is not to discredit good officers but rather to highlight that rank does not necessarily translate into the characters we want to see become MPs ,0.13888888888888887,Positive
So I find it is genuinely refreshing to see someone like Jamus contesting in this election not just because of his CV but because of his national service history He may be an elite but he does not fit in with the stereotype of a PAP elite,0.15,Positive

Do not try to turn the argument around He is clearly not from the PAP mould and even if he were in the PAP given how he worked hard for his portfolio and the way he debates  carry himself it is hard to imagine anyone labeling him an elitist Being well educated DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ELITIST You are only an ELITIST WHEN YOU ARROGANTLY DISMISS ARGUMENTS WITHOUT RATIONALE DEBATE AND POSSESS A SNOBBISH ATTITUDE ,-0.15833333333333333,Negative

My dad was from St Gabs in the 60s70s and while I wasnt from either of these school a sizable number of folks from his era ended up being the first batch of PMETs in the 8090s by benefit of being in that Englishspeaking environment And when they had kids most of them ended up sending their kids back to their Almamater like Montfort and St Gabs some did six years in pri other did 12 all the way to CJ and a number of them ended up doing decently well to get into local u or elsewhere to study lawmedicine What I saying is owing the historical background and see background of these schools there is an edge over your typical 188 schools like yckss ,0.078125,Positive
That being said I should point out this gap is not exclusive to these mission schools these days Go compare the likes of AMKSS Anderson Zhonghua against 188 schools like Peicai Fuchun and North View I can tell by just looking at the school building you can see the gulf in facilities And lets be honest contrary to what LKY said about eugenics we as humans are by far products of your environment and naturing,0.35,Positive
One thing promising however is there will always be students who do overcome this Nowadays there are kids from 188schools who do beat the odds to end up in RIHC it is a token number but still I think what many people dont realize this is arguably harder elsewhere like BritainAustralia ect where society is more stratified,0.275,Positive

The harsh truth is that some schools dont accommodate late bloomers like you They may not offer subjects that are for elite schools such as literature higher music and art pure sciences and humanities 3rd lang for those who are actually willing and eligible to study these subjects or even have the strong aptitude and strength in the subjects Hence I feel that such neighbourhood schools should offer a wider range of subjects to cater to different students needs After all one size doesnt fit all even in schs with higher COPs There are students that are strong in sciences that cant offer pure sciences in their schools due to manpower and resource issues in schs which is a sad fact ,0.08251488095238094,Positive

Honestly I dont see how resources and quality of infrastructure decides whether a school is a good school A common trait of the good schools is good reputation not everyone get score 250 for their PSLE and get into the elite schools but students can still choose a school based on how hooligan rabak it can be More educated parents will definitely want their kids to move away from the bad influences and hence choose schools which they perceived to have better discipline Thats why the top secondary school you see are usually schools with a long history or single sex or religious,0.16857142857142857,Positive

I agree that not every school is a good school Yes things like funding number of CCAs quality of teachers are important but I think these should be secondary factors that constitutes what is a good school or not I feel whats more important is the culture of the school and the quality of students that the school brings in because it is where young minds mingle and I feel that hanging out with friends who are smarter and have higher drive to do well will have an impact on your learning Furthermore these are people who have a higher potential to do well after graduating and you will have a network of friends who are successful For instance look at which schools politicians are from ,0.3409090909090909,Positive

I  also think that although neighborhood schools wants to improve the quality of education they are limited by pragmatism Their syllabus test papers etc and cocurricular activities cannot be too rigorous because some students will not be able to catch up and that is where the potential of students with a higher drive in neighborhood schools are limited by what they are able to do ,0.186734693877551,Positive

I scored well because the teachers in my neighborhood school were dedicated and made sure we understood the fundamentals before progressing In this JC however the teachers did not pay much attention to what we didnt understand and made snide remarks whenever students were struggling with the content This could be a phenomenon across the board due to the insane curriculum but I genuinely feel that the education I received from my neighborhood secondary school is a lot more conducive and nurturing than this elite JC,0.024999999999999998,Positive
 i experienced a somewhat similar thing and i completely understand i moved from a neighbourhood secondary school to an elite jc only to find out there was so much difference in the education we receive i know of so many of my exclassmates who needs passionate teachers like they had who needs good quality notes and good environments to study in i also know that i would have enjoyed learning elective lit rather than being forced to do elective history i too wish that every school was really treated and funded equally only then we can really say theres no such thing as goodbad schools thanks for sharing this op im glad someone feels the same way ,0.20789473684210527,Positive

Its actually Every student is a good student And that is where the education system fails many even the elite schools because it tries to make everyone uniform square pegs to fit in the establishment square holes The system kills the natural human instinct for curiosity and learning instead privilege students can game the system with tuition and lesser advantaged students who do not get the nurture from home lose out substantially Everything we learn is also automatically forgotten the day after exams and we enter the workforce without necessary knowledge about adulting only to be lorded over by foreign highly paid talent who bemoan our lack of critical thinking and creative ideas,0.0771875,Positive

SJI boy here too I was very happy in SJI because while it had much of the opportunity I mean booking a ballroom at the Fullerton for afterschool talks by George Yeo and Tony Tan things were relatively more carefree and there was room to improvise rather than having everything stifled by bureaucracy Anecdotally Ive been told by friends coworkers and dates that there is a perceived SJI profile of irreverence and spontaneity backed by a sharp wit Not that there are no dickheads from there of course,0.2525,Positive

Hi fellow netizens I have read your comments on the recent news on hwa chong,0.0,Neutral
 I am just another netizen who stans a neutral side of this incident but I wish to talk about a few aspects of this incident ,-0.2,Negative
Firstly to all the netizens commenting on hwa chong students and even criticizing the school I must remind you guys that this incident only involves the counsellor and does not involve anyone else including the school or students pov on this incident Hwa Chong has been known to be one of the few elite schools in this nation and have indeed being a school to many successful graduands The information shared by the counsellor is nothing but his personal view or concluded from his research that may not be necessarily correct this I wish that the netizens stop criticizing the school or the students in it they have nothing to do with this and should not be the targeted group ,0.18571428571428572,Positive
Secondly I wish that people who put up hateful comments online could stop doing that From the netizens pov this counsellor is not being sensible and sharing his personal thoughts on being LGBTQ However has it ever occurred to you that the counsellor might also be one of those who suffered from the spread of fake news nowadays Can you imagine this counsellor being just an innocent soul sharing some information that he retrieved online and getting criticized for his actions of trying to share some information with his students I would also have the netizens to sympathize with this counsellor and put yourself in his shoe if you were him how would you feel ,0.0,Neutral
Last but not least I hope that the netizens could close the discussion on this matter The counsellor has already received the punishment that he deserved for not being sensitive enough he is just a normal human being like any one of us he faces the pressure of criticism the fear of losing his job and all that we experience He is the father to his son and the husband to his wife he may not be important to you but he may be to others every comment is hurting him and you netizens are the culprit to it He may have done something wrong but everyone deserves a chance to change and rehabilitate Therefore I hope that if you are part of the LGBTQ community looking at this dont let his behaviours affect your feeling and continue to believe what you believe and if you are not part of this community it is not your business and you have no rights to criticize him as everybody makes mistakes,0.037500000000000006,Positive

maybe such kind of culture made many people choose to cut corners im not saying there shouldnt be any regimental reinforcement aka punishment but it should be executed with responsibility i can understand as a cadet or trainee there is a need to punish and ironically safety rules are enforced to the maximum at bmtc not sure command schools but i suppose instead at unit the punishment isnt really for the punishment here it is used to toughen the minds of fresh soldiers unfortunately punishments has been way overused in cases completely unnecessary and becomes an overused tool of threat if you dont follow my way because i want the results to be like this then i will make you suffer thats where safety systems dont work anymore because people just wanna get it over and done with rather than having to repeat over and over  ,0.05625000000000001,Positive

 like they always say it takes two hands to clap however whats sad is that they havent learnt or realise the root cause of it i used to pride myself as a worker willing to do anything but unfortunately it only seems the highest up choose to ignore the real problems they mustve known the fundamental problem of why isnt all these safety protocols working because many years back they were also the backbone at the lowest levels but even themselves practiced these shortcuts against whats listed in the protocol its human culture and its bad they have probably disconnected with the fundamental peopleall the subordinates of the saf probably being in that elite class for too long if you see why theres so many yellow shirts in france its the same thing the president being disconnected with the grassroots  ,0.01666666666666668,Positive

despite that i have to say its unfair to always and solely just to blame the supervisingconducting etc it is difficult to take a look out or account for so many people thats why buddy system to look out of peers was in place i wish i could elaborate more on this but there really things that are not allowed to be disclosed out of the nature Ive heard much more stories of accidents from my superiors which were of really confidential in nature and even happen to know of those who were involved thats why i say its unfair just to blame those regulars at the grassroot level directly  ,0.09999999999999999,Positive
last thing it is still too early to comment about any particular incident i just feel very saddened for all the bashing the vicious cycle has obviously been ignored for too longeverything about results everything about threatening everything about getting over and done with which is why safety was not practiced or enforced enough the top management obviously has lost touch for too long,-0.008333333333333333,Negative

Yet another theory that is less discussed and debated is the strike while the iron is hot or grow the economy at all cost and on steroids theory,0.04166666666666667,Positive
Under this hypothesis the government is fully aware about allowing a foreign worker OVERFLOW because it wants to hurriedly create a bigger and bigger economy to justify its bigger and bigger pay check ,0.04642857142857143,Positive
Under this hypothesis the government has decided to sacrifice a significant number of our local and older Singaporean workforce because they are not skilled and educated enough to fit into the new and boosted economy,0.11829004329004329,Positive
They can very well remain as security guards cleaners  landscapers  grab drivers  food and online delivery riders,0.2,Positive
The true beneficiaries of the inflated and somewhat artificial economy on steroids are themselves the ruling elites their loyal businessmen supporters  Temasek and GIC the GLC loyalists the Singaporean elite professionals like lawyers bankers accountants etc and another perhaps 20 of locals who ride on the coat tails of the boosted economy such as real estate agents  tuition teachers and clever consultants etc,0.075,Positive
The hundreds of thousands of new Singaporeans and PRs who came in over the last two decades in tandem with foreign multinationals can arguably be credited with bringing in new economy businesses to Singapore and making our economy much bigger and more modern than would otherwise be the case  just look at the Malaysian economy without the benefit of global MNCs and foreign talent flows,0.08030303030303029,Positive
So in conclusion the real reason for the foreign worker OVERFLOW into Singapore since 2005 maybe deliberate and calculated rather than accidental and due to careless oversight,-0.1375,Negative
There are just too many adult born and bred Singaporeans today who are under educated  through no fault of theirs because there were too few universities due to past policy mistakes   The mismatch is already cast in stone and its too late to teach an old pony new tricks no matter how much government propaganda suggesting that this can be done,0.006136363636363634,Positive
Up the ante to educate and upskill the young Singaporeans today so that they will not fall into the similar trap of their under educated parents  Thats an obvious policy strategy,0.03333333333333333,Positive
The past policy mistake of under educating hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans has inadvertently led to the dire consequence of over rewarding a minority of local Singaporeans and severely under compensating a majority of our older and under educated Singaporeans hence the stagnation of medium wages  ,0.10416666666666666,Positive
That is the ugly truth,-0.7,Negative
Work fare and tripartite progressive wage models are just signs of desperate and late in the day attempts to help underpaid older Singaporean employees whose based wages were so ridiculously depressed in the past that escalating the increase would only bring them to 1500 today and 2350 by 2028  compared to  ruling elites who are paid millions,-0.21944444444444444,Negative
So my final point is that the economic fruits of an artificially charged economy on steroids have created enormous wealth to the nation BUT an equally high cost or externality,-0.047999999999999994,Negative
The ruling elites their loyal supporters and a few fortunate Singaporeans reap most of the benefits leaving the majority of Singaporeans to scramble over the crumbs,0.2583333333333333,Positive

Normal children can be stressful you know Stress is not a reason to murder someone In fact I feel parents have high hopes for their normal children and send them enrichment tuition iq class swimming class tennis fencing golf volunteer to go elite schools etc in fact could be even more stressful than an autistic child because they usually no longer hope this child can be very successful and be the pride of the family Within such comments about I empathise with the father and the stress is already prejudice and judgement that the 2 boys which we know very little about are difficult to live with What I am trying to say is this Stress is not a reason to murder people The reason why people find it more acceptable that the murder is for autistic children is because deep inside they already judge that such disabled people are more dispensable and its not worth stressing over them That is why people empathise with the father once they find out the murder is 2 autistic children Why would he bother to stress over these autistic kids who will be useless anyway Stress over autistic kids are not worth it and understandable They empathise with him because they themselves already judge that the autistic children are not worth stressing about Society has already prejudged those boys and the sympathy if you read the comments is overwhelmingly towards the father who is stressed by autistic kids,0.014911616161616167,Positive
